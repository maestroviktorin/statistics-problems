# Statistics problems

This repository contains solving algorithms for some types of simple statistics problems.

## Same variance hypothesis

Algorithm for solving problems of the following type.

Given: significance ratio, sample of a random variable $X$, sample of a random variable $Y$.  
To figure out: Is it appropriate to assume $Var(X) = Var(Y)$ ?

## Normal Distribution Hypothesis

Algorithm for solving problems of the following types.

- Given: significance ratio, empirical frequency sample, theoretical frequency sample.  
   To figure out: Is it appropriate to assume that the empirical sample is a sample of a Normal Distribution?
- Given: significance ratio, empirical frequency sample, random value
            ranges corresponding to the empirical frequency sample.  
   To figure out: Is it appropriate to assume that the sample is a sample of a Normal Distribution?
